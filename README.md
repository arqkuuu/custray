# custray
A simple(and bad) X11 tool to create your own tray icons. 

# Installation
It depends on libx11, libxfixes and imlib2. You should probably install them.

Then clone this repository and cd into it with
```
git clone https://github.com/arqkuuu/custray && cd custray
```
and then run 
```
sudo make clean install
```
Done.

# Usage
See ```custray -h``` :3

# TODO

1) Signal handler to dynamically switch icons
6) Maybe rewrite it in xcb
2) Delete this trash

# I need menus and submenus and subsubmenus and subsubsubmenus and subsubsubsubmenus and sfkasfk

See [xmenu](https://github.com/phillbush/xmenu). It's cool.
