# custray
A simple(and bad) tool to create your own tray icons.

# Installation
It depends on x11lib, libxfixes and imlib2. You should probably install them.

Then clone this repository and cd into it with
```
git clone https://github.com/arqkuuu/custray && cd custray
```
and then run 
```
sudo make clean install
```
Done.

# Usage
See ```custray -h``` :3

# TODO
1. Signal handler to dynamically switch icons
2. Delete this trash
